#### Summary

Pupdates is a social mobile app that is designed for those who want to meet people through their dogs. Users are able to flip through pictures of dogs on their phones and chat with owners of the dogs they like. The app is written in React Native, which allows for cross device compatibility.

The data is persisted in MongoDB, where a Node JS API server communicates with it.

I was in charge of owner page, login, as well as the overall UX of the app.
